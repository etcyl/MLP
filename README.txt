Here you will find 16 Python files, one for each unique Boolean logic function (e.g. AND, OR, XOR).
These files use a feedforward neural network architecture known as the Multilayer Perceptron, or MLP. 
I took an OOP-approach toward this application. In addition to being able to modify the training
parameters (such as number of iterations for training the MLP), one is also able to use a 
trainAndPrint() function in order to see how the accuracy changes as a function of the training
iterations. 

I train the network using three layers: one input layer, one "hidden" layer, and the output
layer. The input and hidden layer both contain two neurons while the output layer contains a single
neuron.
